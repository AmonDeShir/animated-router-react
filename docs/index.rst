**Animated Router** Animated Router is a routing library for React. With it doing page transitions stop being such an inconvenience. Animated Router is simple to use and flexible. Your transitions are just a JavaScript function that gives you a reference to your page (forward ref react component) as an argument. So to create your animations, you can use whatever you want, for example, a powerful library like GSAP, CSS transitions or animations, or just a pure javascript.
